A bunch of different code snippets from different programs/ projects I've worked on.

BoneShaderColored:
From my Unity Custom Realtime Rigging project. Below is one of the shaders I developed that manipulates all the vertices by the rig. The shader uses the vertex color to determine what bone matrix it is assigned to and applies it to the vertex transform. It also assigns a unique color to each vertex based off what bone theyâ€™re assigned to. Useful for making sure that vertices are assigned to the correct bones when rigging using our system.
